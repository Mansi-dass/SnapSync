# Getting Started with SnapSync!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To set up SnapSync:
Make sure your system has **node.js** installed. Then, run:
```
npm install
```
Now, you need Appwrite's API endpoint and IDs, for that create an account on [Appwrite](https://cloud.appwrite.io/),\
Then, update all the necessary endpoints and IDs on **.env** file, then run:
```
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
